My name is Sam Weaver, and I am thrilled to present my portfolio. As a senior at the esteemed University of Maryland Baltimore County, I am on the cusp of completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Geography and Environmental Science, along with a certificate in GIScience. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a profound passion for exploring the intricate connections between our natural environment and the dynamic field of geography.

In terms of professional experience, I have had the privilege of working as a survey intern at DroneView, a prominent drone-based LiDAR survey company. This opportunity allowed me to gain hands-on experience in utilizing advanced remote sensing technologies to collect and analyze geospatial data. Additionally, I have been fortunate to serve as a GIS Intern at John Hopkins University's Facilities and Real Estate department. Working in this capacity has enabled me to apply my knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to support the management and analysis of spatial data, contributing to the university's diverse projects.

My skill set encompasses a range of tools and programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, RStudio, QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, and AutoCAD. These skills empower me to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize geospatial data, enabling informed decision-making and solving complex spatial problems. By employing these technologies, I strive to unravel meaningful insights from diverse datasets, effectively communicating the results to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.

Overall, I am an enthusiastic and dedicated geographer with a strong academic foundation, diverse professional experience, and a broad skill set. Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase my expertise in GIS, highlight my proficiency in various programming languages, and demonstrate my ability to apply geospatial analysis techniques in real-world scenarios. I am excited to share my work and contribute to the field of geography and environmental science.
